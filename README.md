# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model – Excel
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model built entirely in Microsoft Excel to estimate the intrinsic value of a company based on its future cash flows.

The model demonstrates strong fundamentals in corporate finance, valuation techniques, and financial modeling, commonly used in equity research, investment banking, and financial analysis roles.

# Objectives

Estimate the intrinsic value of a company using the DCF method

Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF) based on historical performance

Calculate WACC to discount future cash flows

Derive Enterprise Value and Equity Value

Analyze valuation sensitivity to key assumptions



# Model Structure

The Excel model is structured into the following key sections:

1️⃣ Historical Financial Analysis

Revenue growth trends

Operating margins

Tax rates and reinvestment assumptions

2️⃣ Cash Flow Forecasting

Projection of revenues and expenses

Calculation of Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Forecast period assumptions

3️⃣ WACC Calculation

Cost of Equity (CAPM method)

Cost of Debt

Capital structure weights

4️⃣ Valuation

Present value of projected FCFs

Terminal value calculation

Enterprise Value (EV)

Equity Value & Value per Share

5️⃣ Sensitivity Analysis

Impact of changes in:

WACC

Terminal Growth Rate

#Key Concepts Applied
